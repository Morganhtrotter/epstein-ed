					<p className="col-12 testimonialText">"Why Lisa? What makes Lisa Epstein such an 
							outstanding educator and tutor is her care for her students. 
							Not only does Lisa motivate her students to do their best, but 
							she also helps them do so. I have tutoring with Lisa about three 
							times a week both on Zoom and in-person in her office. In my 
							experience with Lisa, I have learned that she is kind, helpful, 
							understanding, and supportive. No matter what, Lisa is always 
							there for me, providing me with the space, time, and materials 
							I need. It only takes me a few moments to explain my homework 
							assignment to her before she and I are having a full discussion 
							on the topic. Aside from being such a knowledgeable tutor, Lisa 
							is also just a great person to be around. She is a good listener 
							and she teaches me how to express myself through writing. Lisa 
							exhibits how to organize work and how to make the most of the 
							time we have together. Overall Lisa has educated me in so many 
							ways, prepared me for eighth grade, and showed me that the key 
							to success is communication. I always feel like I can ask for 
							help and reach out to her. I am eternally grateful to Lisa because 
							she has taught me how to be the best learner I possibly can be."</p>
