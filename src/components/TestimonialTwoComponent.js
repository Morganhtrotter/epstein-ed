							and has been working with Lisa for the past year on strengthening 
							his core writing, recall, and literacy skills. Lisa was able to quickly 
							identify areas of weakness and creatively adapt her lessons in an 
							engaging way that has yielded great results. Lisa clearly loves what 
							she does and is dependable, knowledgeable, patient, and kind. She 
							values children and has the charisma and attitude to gently encourage, 
							and inspire students to meet their potential. Since working together, 
							I feel our son has matured academically and is a more confident writer 
							and overall student. We feel so fortunate to have found Lisa and look 
							forward to watching our son continue to grow!"</p>
